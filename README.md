# My Linkding

My Linkding is a [Linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding) client created with Flutter. [Linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding) is a self hosted bookmark manager. The objective of this project is to give all it's users an application to manage the bookmarks from a mobile device or a desktop computer.

### Development
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run ``flutter pub get`` to install all the dependencies.
3. Run the application on the desired virtual or physical device.

<b>Note:</b> My Linkding uses Riverpod as the state management system. Files ended on ``.g.dart`` are auto generated by Riverpod's code generator and shouldn't be edited manually.
The code generator can be started by running ``dart run build_runner watch``. Then, the process will start on the terminal.
